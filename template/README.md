# __GAME__

A Wii homebrew game built on [magnolia](../magnolia).

## Layout

```
__GAME__/
├── Makefile
├── meta.xml          Homebrew Channel entry
├── source/           game code
├── sprites/          PNGs, embedded into the binary by bin2s
├── audio/            raw PCM, embedded into the binary by bin2s
└── ../magnolia/      the engine, checked out beside this directory
```

## Building

```bash
export DEVKITPRO=/opt/devkitpro
export DEVKITPPC=/opt/devkitpro/devkitPPC
export PATH=$DEVKITPPC/bin:$PATH

make            # build build/__GAME__.dol
make deploy     # stage sdcard/apps/__GAME__/
make dolphin    # push that to the folder Dolphin reads as its SD card
```

`make dolphin` clears the app directory rather than merging, so **saved scores
and settings are deleted on every deploy**. That is right for a dev loop and
wrong to mistake for the game failing to save.

## Assets

Sprites and audio are linked into the binary, not read from the card: assets on a
card can go missing, go stale, or disagree with the code.

Audio is raw signed 16-bit little-endian PCM:

```bash
ffmpeg -i in.ogg -f s16le -acodec pcm_s16le -ar 48000 -ac 2 audio/track.pcm
```

Budget the memory before committing to a format. Clips are held decoded in RAM:

| Format | Rate | One minute |
|---|---|---|
| 48kHz stereo | ~192 KB/s | ~11.5 MB |
| 24kHz mono | ~48 KB/s | ~2.9 MB |

Against the Wii's 24MB, a long track at 48kHz stereo does not fit. Downsample the
music loop with `audio_play_music_fmt()`; keep short effects at 48kHz stereo.

## Testing without a controller

Reaching gameplay by hand needs button presses into an emulator window. Instead:

```c
#define AUTOSTART_GAMEPLAY      1
#define DEBUG_HEARTBEAT_FRAMES  120
```

Then run the `.dol` and read the log. For `printf` to reach Dolphin's log, its
`Logger.ini` needs `OSREPORT = True` and `WriteToFile = True` -- both default to
False, which makes a working trace look like a dead one.

Dolphin also reuses an already-running instance, so kill it between runs or you
will read the previous run's log and debug a binary that is not running.
