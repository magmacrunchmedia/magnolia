/* The counting and reporting shared by the host tests.
 *
 * Deliberately this small. A test that fails should say which check failed and
 * what it wanted, and the run should exit non-zero -- everything past that is a
 * framework nobody asked for, and a dependency the whole point of these tests is
 * not to have.
 *
 * Each test is its own binary, so these can live in the header. They are
 * `inline` rather than plain `static` so that a test which happens not to need
 * one of them still compiles warning-clean under -Wall -Wextra.
