# magnolia - Wii game engine library by magmacrunch
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Games consume the sources directly; add this engine to your own Makefile with:
#   SOURCES  := source ../magnolia/source ../magnolia/font
#   INCLUDES := ../magnolia ../magnolia/source ../magnolia/font source
#
# This Makefile builds the engine STANDALONE into libmagnolia.a. Its only purpose
# is to prove the engine compiles with no game on the include path -- if engine
# code ever reaches for a game header again, this build fails immediately rather
# than the coupling being discovered by the next game months later.
#
#   make          build libmagnolia.a
#   make test     run all host-side tests (no devkitPPC, no console)
#   make test-menu, test-gamestate, test-input, ...   run just one of them
#   make clean
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The host tests deliberately need no cross-compiler: requiring devkitPPC to run
# them would put them out of reach on the machine where they are most useful.
# Named once, so the guard below and the rules further down cannot drift apart --
# `make test-menu` on a laptop with no cross-compiler has to work too.

# Anything in source/ that is free of libogc is tested on the machine you are
# sitting at, in a second, with no emulator in the loop. That matters more than
# it sounds: an emulated SD card can refuse every write while reporting itself
# mounted, and a test that runs on the host is the one that can tell a broken
# save from a broken card.
#
# The source list per binary is written out rather than wildcarded. It is the
# record of which engine modules are host-clean -- a wildcard would cheerfully
# try to link renderer.c and fail with something far less informative.

# -Werror because CONTRIBUTING already requires warning-clean builds, and
# without it that rule is honour-system: CI stays green on a new warning and
# nobody finds out until the warnings are too many to read. Only the host
# tests get it. The cross build is left alone deliberately -- a devkitPPC
# bump can introduce warnings inside third-party headers, and stopping the
# console build over someone else's header is a different trade.
